                <p>What is Parallax?</p>
                <p>Parallax is a visual effect in web design and development where the background content (such as images or elements) moves at a slower rate than the foreground content as the user scrolls through a page. This creates an illusion of depth and immersion, mimicking how objects closer to the viewer appear to move faster than those farther away. Originally inspired by techniques used in traditional animation and video games, parallax scrolling has become a popular trend in modern web design to make websites more dynamic and engaging. By adding this effect, designers can guide user attention, tell a story, or simply enhance the overall aesthetic appeal of a webpage.</p>
                <p>The parallax effect works by leveraging CSS properties like `transform`, `translateZ()`, or background position shifts in combination with JavaScript for smoother or more complex implementations. It is particularly effective in creating a sense of layered depth in single-page websites, portfolios, and storytelling experiences. However, while it can elevate the user experience, overusing parallax effects may negatively impact performance on lower-end devices or distract users from the main content. Therefore, implementing parallax requires a careful balance between creativity and functionality to ensure an optimal user experience.</p>
